# **Analysis & Recommendations**
## **Key Issues**
1. **No Pause Function**: Long gaming sessions can cause fatigue. A pause option or “rest reminder” feature is recommended.
2. **Enemy AI Behavior**: Enemies freeze when out of player vision, breaking immersion. Improving AI behavior to maintain activity off-screen is recommended.
3. **Linear Level Design**: Limited path choices reduce exploration, a core element in roguelike games. Adding alternative routes would enhance replayability.

## **Other Issues**
- **Enhance Visual Feedback**: Improve contrast between characters, enemies, and bullets for better tracking and combat awareness.
- **Skill Cooldown Feedback**: Introduce visual or audio cues for skill cooldowns to enhance combat strategy.
- **Fix Collision Issues**: Address invisible wall problems to ensure smoother navigation and better player movement experience.
